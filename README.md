# Weblayer

Weblayer is a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor
that let you build data-driven web applications easily.

You use Weblayer to design the interface and database of your application
by dragging and dropping components and you export the result
in Ruby on Rails source code that you can self-host.
